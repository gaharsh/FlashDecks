# FlashDecks

"For students who want a more accessible and efficient way to study using flashcards, FlashDecks provides an online alternative to typical paper flashcards, that is both simple and effective to use for studying."

Primarily, this web app will be directed at students. There is no specific age-group target of students, so this product will aim to be simple and effective to use, while also visually appealing. This product will allow users to create decks of flashcards and save them to sets. Users will be able to randomize the order in which they view each deck, and edit accordingly.
